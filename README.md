# HUGO based Private Web Page

This is the repository for the workings of my academic blog, constructed with https://gohugo.io/.
I have it separate from the rendered branch, because git branches and submodules confuse
me.

The published site is at: http://jarvist.github.io/

## Setup & notes

## Notes for Future
