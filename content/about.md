### Research Statement

Over 122 PetaWatts of solar power reach the Earth's surface. This figure is
vastly greater than the 15 TeraWatts (while still a crazy big number, that's
only 0.015 PetaWatts) which is humanity's total power requirement.

So long term, I think it is inevitable that all of our power will come from
solar. All the energy in fossil fuels is essentially ancient sunlight, captured
by inefficient photosynthesis and geological happenstance.

Solar cells (formally called photovoltaics, as they generate electrical voltage
from photons of light) are a beautifully simple engine that silently run on
sunlight and thermodynamics to produce electrical power. There are no parts to
wear out, no bearings to service, no oil to change. The only problem is that
the solar resource is not very concentrated — bright sunlight is about
a kilowatt per metre squared. So you have to build big panels to produce
a meaningful amount of energy.

Our present best technology for making photovoltaics is based on Silicon. This
is an abundant material (sand is mainly Silicon Dioxide), but forming pure
Silicon requires a lot of energy, and making Silicon solar panels requires
vacuum processing and some pretty nasty chemicals which keeps the cost
relatively high.

My research is in trying to understand and design new materials for solar
cells. By using computational chemistry and materials science techniques we try
to understand how novel solar cells work (in particular, what limits their
efficiency or longevity), and how we can make them better. These new solar
cells are typically more complex than Silicon cells – relying on a subtle
interplay of multiple elements in a particular crystal structure or fiendishly
complex molecules dreamt up by an organic chemist.

I work with computational physics techniques. The equations which govern the
behaviour of our everyday materials are simple to write down, but impossible to
solve exactly for any but the most trivial of examples. Instead we rely on
computational algorithms to numerically solve approximate models for the real
system. Even very limited and flawed solutions of small systems can require
absolutely stunning amounts of computer time. Validating (against reality)
these models and understanding the limits of the techniques available, is what
I spend the majority of my time doing.

At Bath I am in the Chemistry Department, funded under the EPSRC Programme
Grant Energy Materials: Computational Solutions,
working in the Walsh Material Design group. So far the majority of my
computer time has been provided by EPSRC on the new Cray XC30 supercomputer
ARCHER.

### This blog & other presence

This is my academic (mainly!) blog. It used to be on wordpress, at
<https://jarvistmoorefrost.wordpress.com>. 
Files were extracted to a plain text Markdown format, and are now published
with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the `nofancy` theme (slightly
tweaked). 
I moved this blog from Wordpress to GitHub pages as I had grown irritated with
the online-only editing experience (in particular their new 'Web 2.0'
experience). 
I hope that being able to edit and push from the command line will get me
blogging more regularly.

In January 2016 I started using a Google+ 'Collection' to publish [reviews of
Electronic Structure Theory books](https://plus.google.com/collection/wKpRZB).

Outside academics, I have less and less time for riding bicycles, sailing,
diving and exploratory caving. 
But the little I have written up, is accessible at
<https://jarvbites.wordpress.com/>.
