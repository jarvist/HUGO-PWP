### Research statement

Over 122 Petawatts of solar power reach the Earth's surface. This figure is
vastly greater than humanity's total power requirement.  
(Which is 15 Terawatts, while still a crazy big number, is only 0.015 Petawatts.)

Long term I think it is inevitable that all of our power will be solar power.
60 GWp of solar power was installed during 2016, the growth is currently
exponential.  
All the energy in fossil fuels is essentially ancient sunlight, captured
by inefficient photosynthesis and geological happenstance.

Solar cells (formally called photovoltaics, as they generate electrical voltage
from photons of light) are a beautifully simple engine that silently run on
sunlight and thermodynamics to produce electrical power. There are no parts to
wear out, no bearings to service, no oil to change. The only problem is that
the solar resource is not very concentrated — bright sunlight provides about
a kilowatt of power per metre squared. 
So you have to build big panels (and cover a not insignificant land area) to
produce a meaningful amount of energy.

Our present best technology for making photovoltaics is based on Silicon. This
is an abundant material (sand is mainly silicon dioxide), but forming pure
Silicon requires a lot of energy, and making silicon solar panels requires
vacuum processing and some pretty nasty chemicals which keeps the cost
relatively high.

My research is in trying to understand and design new materials for solar
cells. 
We try to understand how experimental solar cells work (in particular, what limits
their efficiency or longevity), and how we can make them better. These new
solar
cells are typically more complex than silicon cells – rely on the subtle
interplay of multiple elements in a complex structure or fiendishly
complex molecules dreamt up by an organic chemist (and then we often don't even
know the structure!). 

I work with computational physics techniques. 
Everything we see and touch and hear is due to the electronic structure of the
materials around us. 
The equations which govern this quantum mechanical behaviour are simple to
write down, but impossible to solve exactly for any but the most trivial of
examples. 
Instead we rely on computational algorithms to numerically solve approximate
models for the real system.

Even very limited and flawed solutions of small systems can require
absolutely stunning amounts of computer time. 
The systems I woke on are often disordered, and dynamically responding,
requiring new methods to be developed, and toy models to be devised. 
Validating (against reality) these models and understanding the limits of the
techniques available, is what I spend the majority of my time doing.

At Bath I am in the Chemistry Department, funded under the EPSRC Programme
Grant Energy Materials: Computational Solutions, working in the Walsh Material
Design group. 
Since September 2016 I have been physically based in the Department of
Materials, Imperial College London.  
So far the majority of my computer time has been provided by EPSRC on the new
Cray XC30 supercomputer ARCHER.

### This blog & other online presence

This is my academic (mainly!) blog. It used to be on Wordpress, at
<https://jarvistmoorefrost.wordpress.com>. 
Files were extracted to a plain text Markdown format, and are now published
with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the `nofancy` theme (slightly
tweaked). 
I moved this blog from Wordpress to GitHub pages as I had grown irritated with
the online-only editing experience (in particular their new 'Web 2.0'
experience made my laptop overheat!). 
I hope that being able to edit and push from the command line will get me
blogging more regularly.

In January 2016 I started using a Google+ 'Collection' to publish [reviews of
Electronic Structure Theory books](https://plus.google.com/collection/wKpRZB).

You may find my academic papers on [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=qNlfsFEAAAAJ&hl=en), or via my [ORCID ID](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1938-4430).

On Twitter I'm [@JarvistFrost](https://twitter.com/JarvistFrost). 
Find my Molecular Dynamics videos on  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/jarvist1984/)
I try and put my conference slides on
[SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/jarvist), as and when I've had time to
redact any unpublished experimental data of collaborators. 

Outside academics, I have less and less time for riding bicycles, sailing,
diving and exploratory caving. 
But the little I have written up, is accessible at
<https://jarvbites.wordpress.com/>.
