I'm an electronic structure theorist. I specialise in writing bespoke bits
of code to build computer models which represent messy, disordered materials. 
These materials are more difficult to simulate than perfect crystals
because within them the symmetries that gives physics such predictive power are broken. 

I have applied my skills to modelling new materials for energy conversion and
storage. 
Here the disorder is due to engineering the material with minimal environmental
impact, which usually means making it quickly and with little energy. 

I find the mixture of statistical physics (all those atoms jiggling and
wiggling!) and quantum mechanics (all those electrons zooming
around) really exciting to imagine and simulate. 
This work will help us design the materials of the future.
