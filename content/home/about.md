I'm an electronic structure theorist. 
I specialise in writing bespoke computer code to build models which represent
messy, disordered materials. 
These materials are more difficult to simulate than perfect crystals
because the symmetry that normally gives physics such predictive
power are broken. 

I find the mixture of statistical physics (all those atoms jiggling and
wiggling!) and quantum mechanics (all those electrons zooming
around) really exciting to imagine and simulate. 
This work will help us design the materials of the future.

Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=qNlfsFEAAAAJ), and my
