description = """Humanity needs new energy materials to build a future with
reduced environmental impact. One key future application is in large-scale
solar energy production and storage.

But making new materials is expensive. If we can model these materials
accurately on a computer, we can save time and money. Materials for solar power
are complex, and often soft and disordered. Our models work best for simple
materials that are hard and ordered.

An exact solution of the Schrodinger equation that we need to solve would take
an infinite amount of computer time. Using bespoke models and computer
programs, we can make approximations that allow us to predict the material
qualities we need (such as colour, transparency, strength and conductivity).
The more complicated the material, the more approximations we need to make.

Soft materials have a large interaction between the motion of the atoms and the
electrons. Often this interaction is ignored in simulation. Adding this
interaction back in is a common theme within this project, allowing more
accurate prediction of properties, particularly where temperature and atomic
motion is involved.

In my project, we will design better mathematical approximations, write these
into computer programs, and run these programs on super-computers. These will
simulate solar-cell materials, to understand why current materials have
a limited efficiency, and to design the higher-efficiency solar-cell materials
of the future. These techniques will also be applied to batteries, to design
a battery that can be charged faster, and for more cycles before degrading."""

  description = """Drugs are particularly difficult to simulate on a computer as biological
molecules are very floppy, and there is water everywhere.
This leads to a lot of disorder.
This disorder (entropy) needs to be treated accurately to get the correct
free-energy, and therefore predictions of what will happen.
