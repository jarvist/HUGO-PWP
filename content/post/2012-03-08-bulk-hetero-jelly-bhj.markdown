For my 28th birthday I report on the **Bulk Hetero Jelly** (BHJ). Unlike conventional Jellies, the BHJ architecture allows for a fully solution processed deposition at lower temperatures and without the vacuum processing necessary for conventional designs. The Molar scale phase separation is achieved implicitly by the kinetically limited dynamics of the slithering snakes and foam strawberries, which are then 'frozen' in place by the increasing viscosity of the support matrix. Selectivity of the contacts is enabled by the differing optical absorption (see UV-Vis data in supplementary info) of the two gel processed contact layers.

A MolybdenumOxide-coloured sugar ball Self-Assembled-Monolayer (SAM) is emplaced by gel-penetrating gravity enhanced sputtering, shortly after top contact coating. This has no noticeable effect on device performance, but I did it anyway because it's what all the hip kids out East do.

Orthogonal solvents are not required as the device is cooled to ambient between layer depositions, which sufficiently protects the previous layers from dissolving. No chlorinated solvents are needed, but I like the smell.

The fractal dimension of the snakes and foam strawberries was calculated through assessing the Hurst exponent for various discretisations of bright-field 2D macro-graphs. The snakes have a fractal dimension of 1.4 and the strawberries have a dimension of 1.9. I choose not to analyse these data in any way as to do so would undervalue the sanctity of the big D.

I consider this the crowning moment of my experimental physics career, and may provide a future bulk jelly production method for the whole of humanity.
