Google Reader has finally shut up shop. Eight years, many scientific papers, snippets of technology news, new music and many many blogs; we had some good times.

All the replacements currently available still seem to be a bit unsatisfying - Reader feeder updates were really quite amazingly fast, and the interface was clean. There will now be a lot of starred articles which I'll never read, and old cached blog posts which have disappeared for ever.

A lot of the 'modern' readers seem to be aiming for a modern 'waterfall of news' presentation whereas I like the simple reverse-date rows! I'm undecided between the following three alternatives - probably The Old Reader is the most complete & stable, and is aiming to be like Google Reader before they removed the sharing / social features, but it's arguably the ugliest.
