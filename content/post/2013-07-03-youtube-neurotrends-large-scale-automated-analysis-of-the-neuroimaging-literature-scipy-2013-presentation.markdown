[YouTube: NeuroTrends: Large-scale automated analysis of the neuroimaging literature; SciPy 2013 Presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqE3JcHR6VQ)

Interesting presentation on doing meta analysis of results in scientific papers via automated scraping with a python code.

For me the 'sciscrape' library is probably the most interesting thing (regexp based on the raw text):Â [https://github.com/jmcarp/sciscrape](https://github.com/jmcarp/sciscrape)

Seems to have a typical story arc of developing an automated tool - Carp extracted data by hand from 250 papers before expending the effort to code a scraper, then used on 30'000 HTML & PDFs!
