All ab-initio papers should feature extensive Douglas Adams references:Â [http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.physchem.59.032607.093602](http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.physchem.59.032607.093602)  
  
This is a nice gentle introduction to EOM-CoupledCluster: "The conceptual simplicity of EOM-CC, the robustness of single-reference implementation, and the bulk of applications demonstrating the capabilities of EOM allow even nonexperts to see the marvels of the open-shell universe on their own, without the close involvement of electronic-structure specialists. Happy hitchhiking!"
