[Advanced R Programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)

Advanced R Programming is being written in an open manner by Hadley Wickham (ggplot2). It's nearing completion & printing, but the Wiki form of the content will remain online in perpetuity. R is a really difficult language to google answers to (it's all short-hand functions & punctuation <- $ ^ which gets stripped or is not very searchable), and the documentation I've found so far has been  lacklustre. The little I've read of these notes seem absolutely fantastic.
