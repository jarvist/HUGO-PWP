[ARCHER](http://www.archer.ac.uk/) is the new EPSRC/NERC High Performance Computing facility, the successor to [HeCToR](http://www.hector.ac.uk/). We have early access to it during its testing phase (until 16th Dec). The transition has been extremely impressive, the new machine is stunningly powerful (#19 in the world on the Top500 Nov 2013 list, a Cray XC30 on just-fabbed Intel Ivy Bridge processors ) and everything seems to more or less just work. The login nodes are responsive, the file systems as well.Â 

As I've been putting together scripts / utilities for running jobs on Archer (just VASP presently), I've been uploading them to a github repository, in case anyone else may find them useful. Here be dragons!
