This is a collection of bookmarks I've collected over the years of useful
online physics notes; hopefully this will be of some use to others. 
My bias is as a computational physicist doing electronic structure theory for
materials modelling, so all within the remit of condensed matter theory (no
high energy physics, for instance, and nothing that would count as
'theoretical' research for the last forty years at least). 
Expect little outside pedestrian quantum mechanics and statistical physics, and
the one fundamental force you can actually interact with.

Partially inspired by Gerard 't Hooft's far more complete summary

## Lecture Notes

**Richard Feynman** (Caltech) The Feynman lectures on physics are now available
to read freely online.
<http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/>

**Lev Landau** (Moscow) The original theoretical minimum; Landau's fantastic
series translated into English are available freely on the Internet archive. 
<https://archive.org/details/Mechanics_541> - start with mechanics and search
around!

**David Tong** (Cambridge) has written a highly recommended series of
undergraduate (UG) notes. 
<http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html>

**Leonard Susskind** (Stanford) has a set of Youtube lectures as part of the
Stanford Continuing Studies series. I like his very clear lecture style. 
The 2013 Stat Mech (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_IkS0viawhr3HcKH607rXbVqy28W_gB7) and Advanced QM (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcC5RwLpGl6eyNvVfAixR18_nDmsX9rh-) courses I really enjoy. 

The accesssible 
course also dovetails with the recently published books (written with Art
Friedman).

**Richard Fitzpatrick** (UT Austin) offers lecture notes, including some at the
graduate level.
<http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching.html>

**Dan Styer** (Oberlin) maintains a good set of Quantum-Mechanics notes on the
web including a primer of common misconceptions. 
<http://www.oberlin.edu/physics/dstyer/TeachQM/>

**Matthew Foulkes** (Imperial) has a pleasingly dense and direct postgrad
course on electrons in solids - from UG Physics to DFT in 6 sections  
<http://www.cmth.ph.ic.ac.uk/people/m.foulkes/pdf/esolids.pdf>

**John Kitchin** (Carnegie Mellon) has a set of notes on periodic DFT
calculations (with VASP) and a Python primer (with the Atomic Simulation
Environment) in doing materials modelling calculations.

<http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/>

**Stefan Grimme** (Bonn) has a great intro-to-QuantumChemistry set of notes which
bridges the gap between a QM course and the terms used in typical codes.
<http://www.thch.uni-bonn.de/tc/teaching/qc2/downloads/>

**Sherrill Group** (Georgia Tech) have a set of notes and Youtube videos on
quantum chemistry. 
<http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/notes/index.html>

**TDDFT School** TDDFT school research talks; rewrite the URL with a bit of
a guess for other years!
<http://www.tddft.org/TDDFT2014/school/>

## Journal Clubs

Papercore is an interesting idea - produce a 'super abstract' summary of
a research paper. Quite a spin-glass focus for the papers in here, where
I guess it is used as the internal journal club.

## Books

In truth, all the best stuff is in the books; quality and presentation of the
above notes is relatively hit and miss, and more polished and complete at the
undergraduate level. 

Physics is quite an esoteric pursuit, so unless you have access to a university
you are unlikely to be able to find much beyond the Landau/Livshitz 'Course in
Theoretical Physics' and the Feynman lectures in your library. 
Most physics books are horrendously expensive.

However, the Dover Books reissues in physics are fantastic and cheap; like
classic movies a few decades hindsight has allowed the editors to sort the
wheat from the chaff.  The Futura / Bauhaus design for the latest covers is
extremely aesthetically pleasing.
Beware that some of the books from the dawn of Quantum Theory are more there
for historical interest than utility as a textbook.
