This looks like it might be extremely useful for a personal knowledge base / article discussion. It's setup more for humanities work currently (books, biographies and authors), than science (some way to import a DOI to build a paper-discussion place would be fantastic). A collaborative journal club / papercore / paper summary might also work wonderfully within here.

Update 2017-01-01: Unfortunately it doesn't appear to have been updated since
August 2014. There is some discussion as to why here:

As such, it probably makes most sense to stay with the present version of
TiddlyWiki & use it instead: http://tiddlywiki.com/
