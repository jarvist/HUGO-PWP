I polished some slides I gave at our group meeting last summer, on using 'ssh' proficiently at Bath university. I thought they may be of use to other's, so published them online.

They mainly cover the setting up of a ssh-config (the examples are probably useful for most people that use HPC facilities), and tunneling via the LCPU facility (fairly Bath specific, though other academic institutes might offer a similar unix machine in a DMZ to bounce through).
