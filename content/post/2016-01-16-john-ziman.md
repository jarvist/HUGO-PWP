I've learnt more from John Ziman's books on electronic structure, phonons, and
disorder, than from any other single source.
This is a little guide to his academic works.

1979 - "Models of disorder". Though his most recent book, from the printing you
would assume it was from the 50s! This is the only real attempt to write
a textbook summarising all approaches to disorder in electronic structure
modelling. As a pioneer of liquid metals, this was his area of expertise. It
many ways it is woefully out of date - but is still the only complete summary
of the field, and still extremely useful. Without fast computers, effective
medium theories are the only tool for this non analytic problems, which are
developed with increasing tiers of sophistication and approximation. It's the
only proper description of the motivation and construction of the coherent
potential approximation which I know of. If you work in the electronic
structure of disordered materials you would be foolhardy not to own this book.

1964/1971 - "Principles of the Theory of Solids" - 2nd edition (1971) is
apparently improved on the 1st edition (1964) but I haven't sat down and cross
compared. Undergraduate level electronic structure, but extremely readable and
insightful, and with carefully penned diagrams which somehow are far more
informative than today's computer generated masterpieces.

1971 - The Calculation of Bloch Functions
A great review of the state of the art of electronic structure calculations in
1971, from LCAO, the Cellular method, Pseudopotentials and Orthogonalised Plane
Waves, then into Augmented Plane Waves (Muffin Tin) and the KKR method.

1969 - "Elements of advanced quantum theory". The most clear introduction to
more advanced QM concepts I know of, assuming an undergraduate physics degree
level of understanding . His description of quantum theory as being a Ziggurat
of insurmountable cliffs unlocking enormous plains of understanding is
fantastic.
In this book he covers creation + annihilation operators for Bosons, then
Fermions, into 'classical' perturbation theory, then S-matrix scattering,
through to Green's Functions, a chapter on what we'd now class as Electronic
Structure theory (Thomas Fermi DFT, Hartree Fock, Random Phase Approximation,
Dielectric Response, Superconductors), a chapter on relativistic treatment, and
finishing with a group theory summary. A true delight, and readily available as
a well printed paperback.

1962 - "Electrons in metals: A short guide to the Fermi surface" - A long
review article, a fantastic ~few hour read guide to electronic structure, and
a great introduction to whether you will like Ziman's writing style.

1960 - "Electrons and Phonons: The Theory of Transport Phenomena in Solids".
The bible for electron-phonon interaction. All the examples are carefully
worked. The only critique I have is that it so predates fast digital computers
that the possibility of being able to calculate matrix elements with brute
force isn't on the horizon. As such, a lot of detailed derivations stop halfway
through & start making coarse approximations.

Michael Berry & John Nye's biography is a very interesting read also detailing
his non-physics publications and interests.
