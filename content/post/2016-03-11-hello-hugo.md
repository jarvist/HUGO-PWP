This blog used to be on wordpress, at
<https://jarvistmoorefrost.wordpress.com>. 
( There are a few comments by other people scattered amongst those posts, I'm
not sure how to best transfer / archive these. )

Files were extracted to a plain text Markdown
format, and are now published with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the
`nofancy` theme (slightly tweaked). I moved this blog from wordpress as I had
grown irritated with the editing experience, and I hope that being able to edit
and push from the command line would get me blogging more regularly.

Time will see.
